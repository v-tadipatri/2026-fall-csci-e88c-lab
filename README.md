## Programming in Scala for Big Data Systems, Fall 2026
Scala Project for Harvard Extension course CSCI E-88C, Fall, 2026. See course details at [Scala for Big Data](https://courses.dce.harvard.edu/?details&srcdb=202601&crn=16769).


This project is a multi-module setup for Scala applications that integrate with big data frameworks like Spark, Beam, and Kafka. It is designed to facilitate development in a structured manner, allowing for modular code organization and easy dependency management.

The project requires Java 17, Scala 2.13 and sbt 1.9.2+ environment to run.

## Project Structure
- **core**: Contains the core library code shared across other modules.
- **cli**: Implements the command-line interface for the application.
- **spark**: Contains Spark-specific code and configurations.
- **build.sbt**: The main build file for the project, defining the modules and their dependencies.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and its structure.

## Build Tool
This project uses [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) (Scala Build Tool) for building and managing dependencies. SBT allows for incremental compilation and easy management of multi-module projects.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/esumitra/2026-fall-csci-e88c.git

   cd 2026-fall-csci-e88c
   ```
2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   sbt compile
   ```
3. **Run the CLI**:
   ```bash
   sbt "cli/run John"
   ```

   To packge an executable file use the native packager plugin:
   ```bash
   sbt "cli/stage"
    ```
    This will create a script in the `cli/target/universal/stage/bin` directory that you can run directly.

   e.g., ` ./cli/target/universal/stage/bin/cli John`
4. **Run the Spark application**:
   ```bash
   sbt spark/run
   ```

## Running in DevContainer
This project can be run in a DevContainer for a consistent development environment. Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed. Follow these steps:
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `(Cmd+Shift+P)` and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
3. Wait for the container to build and start.
4. Open a terminal in the DevContainer and run the project using SBT commands as described above.

## Running Spark

1. Start the docker container:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-spark.yml up
   ```
2. Connect to the spark-master:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it spark-master /bin/bash
   ```
3. Run the spark shell interactively:
   ```bash
   /opt/spark/bin/spark-shell
   ```

4. Run the Spark application:

   Submit the Spark job using the `spark-submit` command.

## Submitting the Spark Job
1. First, ensure that your Spark application JAR file is built and available in the `apps/spark` directory. You can build the Spark module using SBT:
   ```bash
   sbt spark/assembly
   ```

2.    Then, copy the JAR file to the appropriate directory:
   ```bash
   cp spark/target/scala-2.13/SparkJob.jar docker/apps/spark
   ```

3.    Finally, submit the Spark job:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it spark-master /bin/bash
   
   /opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --class spark.SparkJob --master spark://spark-master:7077 /opt/spark-apps/SparkJob.jar
   ```
## Docker commands

1. Start the docker container:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-spark.yml up
   ```
2. Check status of running containers:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
3. Review the logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f spark-master
   ```
4. Stop running containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-spark.yml down
   ```
